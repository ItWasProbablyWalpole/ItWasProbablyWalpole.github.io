				Wilbert Schneepleschtoffer, 22, was just having a lovely morning when he logged into his social media, posting a critical post of the current government. <br>
				The post in question suggested that the government "go shove their heads" in a particular area and to "walk off" an extremely high place. <br>
				His surprise was enormous when the entire government quit their jobs and sued Mr. Schneepleschtoffer for emotional damages. <br>
				"It was just so...MEAN!" said John Norbert, an aide who wished to remain anonymous. "It was just...so..." The aide immediately burst into tears. <br>
				Wilbert was taken aback by this sudden change. "Uh...I didn't mean to make the entire government quit. Uh, I mean, the hacker who totally <br>
				hacked my account didn't mean to make the government quit. I mean, I'm sure he didn't want to. Uh, I mean, I don't know his motives." <br>
				When asked if he knew any details about the supposed person who hacked his account, Wilbert was certain of the hacker's identity. <br>
				"Uh...y'know. Like that hacker. Man. I think their name was, like, uh, 4chan?" <br>
				World leaders from all around the world are polarized after this incident, with several leaders denouncing the post, <br>
				and others just really, really confused...<br>
				After being informed of this problem, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was quoted as saying "What the hell?", <br>
				making history as the first Canadian to curse in over 300 years. <br>
				Several fringe anarchist groups have announced their intent to fill the void of power, but are too busy <br>
				trying to convince the internet of their plan and that they are not, indeed, edgy 13 year olds. <br>
				Toxic Facebook communities have blamed millenials, vaccinations, chemtrails, and Bill Clinton <br>
				while pretending to take the moral high ground, despite the fact they've never told the truth in their lives. <br>
				When we interviewed a random person about this monumentous issue, they ran away. <br>
				Government officials have quit their jobs all over the country, throwing America into confusion. <br>
				The nation is in complete shock at this sudden change of events, and yours truly will be providing more details about this current situation. <br>
