<h1> <div id="Local_Man"><font face="papyrus" color="blue" size="30"> CELEBRITY ADMITS THEY BREATHE AIR--UPROAR ENSUES </font> <br> </div>  </h1>
<font size="6" color="black" face="comic sans ms">
				By Correspondent Leigh Murphy, 8/6/2018

			<font face="calibri">
			Last Tuesday, celebrity Tiffany Northwest Kardashopez carelessly made an offhand remark that the  "air was, like, really, um...uh, fresh today! Like yaaaaassssss." <br>
			The Internet, by which we mean several extremely critical, toxic people on Twitter which supposedly represent the entire Internet, has blown up over this issue. <br>
			Avid twitterer XXXedgybleedingheartXXX posted,"Two minutes ago, Tiff Kardashopez just #SAID that the air was fresh. <br> Celebrities can't just
			DO THAT. Celebrities are infallible gods! They don't breathe #AIR. <br> #woke #deep #thinkofthechildren #morelikeNOTcelebrities #ifyouvaxxyougetsmaxx
			They're setting a bad #ROLEMODEL for our children!!!! <br>
			Meanwhile, self-proclaimed fans of Ms. Kardashopez have rushed to her aid.<br>
			"Like, LEAVE TIFFANY ALOOOONE!" exclaimed Ashleeighe Reignbeau, self-proclaimed leader of Kardashopez' fans, the "Tiff Army". <br>"Like, she can like do whatever she wants! She can have ALL THE AIR IN THE WORLD. I WILL GIVE HER MY AIR. I WILL SPEND MY LIFE SAVINGS ON HER MAKEUP." <br>
			Tiffany, who is well known for a show that records her doing absolutely nothing, commented on this issue in a statement far beyond her writing capabilities. <br> "I am deeply sorry about breathing air. It was immature and impulsive of me to do so, and I would like to apologize to all my fans, as I have disappointed all of them. <br> I will promise to be better in the future, and refrain from breathing air. <span id="spanid">NOW WILL YOU BUY MY MERCH AND GIVE ME MONEY</span> Many apologies." <br>
		Our reporters continue to monitor this situation, albeit with much apathy. <br>
